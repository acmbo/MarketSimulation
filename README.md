MarketSimulation is a small market simulation inspired by the youtube video  [Simulating Supply and Demand][link1] 
by Primer [Link added: 25.01.2020]. The aim is to create an object-oriented simulation in which agents communicate 
and trade with each other, according to their need and emulate supply and demand within the market. 

Agents are able to decide, which amount of money they gonna bid on the market for an item and change it according
to the sucess of the bid. Agent, who are selling, can raise their price according to the demand for their item. 
With a roundbased approach the market skript is able to simulate a small ecosystem of actors within the market and 
the changes within the market.
